# System Architecture

## Core Bot Framework
The application uses the Python Telegram Bot library (python-telegram-bot) as the foundation for Telegram integration. The main bot logic is implemented in `bot.py` with a modular design that separates concerns across different components.

## AI Integration Layer
Gemini AI integration is handled through a dedicated `GeminiHandler` class that manages three distinct AI models:
- Text generation using gemini-2.5-flash for conversations
- Image analysis using gemini-2.5-pro for vision tasks
- Image generation using gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation

The handler provides asynchronous methods for generating responses, analyzing images, and creating images based on text prompts.

## Administrative System
A comprehensive admin control system is implemented through the `AdminControls` class, providing bot management capabilities including statistics monitoring, user management, and system controls. Access is restricted to authorized admin users.

## Configuration Management
The `Config` class centralizes all application settings, handling environment variables and providing default values. It includes validation methods to ensure required configuration is present before bot startup.

## Concurrent Operation Design
The application runs two concurrent processes:
1. Telegram bot polling using asyncio for handling user interactions
2. Flask webhook server running in a separate thread for status monitoring and webhook endpoints

This design allows the bot to operate via polling while simultaneously providing a web interface for monitoring and potential webhook integration.

## Rate Limiting and Security
Built-in rate limiting prevents abuse by tracking user request patterns over time windows. The system maintains user contexts for conversation continuity while implementing safeguards against spam and overuse.

## Error Handling and Monitoring
Comprehensive logging is implemented throughout the application with configurable log levels. The system tracks various metrics including message processing, image operations, errors, and uptime statistics.
